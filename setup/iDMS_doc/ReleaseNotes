Release Note:
-------------
2.11.a2
-------
* dmsCPrintIdmsLog/dmsMslPrintIdmsLog procedure to print logs to iDMS log file.
* No header changes from 2.11.a1.
* Fix $include not to affect dms.pth line count.
* Workaround for Dapr fatal on iAWS.

2.11.a1
--------
* dmsCPIInitDMS and dmsMslPIInitDMS procedures have been added a third argument
  for iDMS to know if tools are running in graphic mode or not. Use macros
  defined in fwierr.h and fwierr.hdr to be the input option.  Please read
  documentation:integration for detail.
* User triggers
* Generated attribute: Please read documentation:globalFile for detail.
* Tool configuration policy in dms.pth file: Documentation:dmspath for detail.
* iDMS last cellview information procedure: Documentation:dmspath for detail.
* New documentation
* Working directory token in dms.pth file: Documentation:dmspath for detail.
* Better warning/error messages
* The table named iDMSViewTypeToNameTable in the iDMSglobalTable was renamed to
  iDMSIntelDataFormatToNameTable.
* Two new environment variables
	IDMS_USERTRIGGERFILE -> to point to user trigger file
	IDMS_DISABLEUSERTRIGGER -> to disable above functionality
Details are in the globalFile document.
* A new environment variable 
	IDMS_MAPPINGKEYWORD -> to hold the keyword string value
	based on which iDMS will decide whether a file path is 
	a unix-dir (for unix metadata) or a cadence opus checkout 
	via the mapping function. If not defined the 
	default is "co@"

* Header changes:
 1) fwierr.hdr, fwierr.h: The macro idmsCvHasNoCheckoutToBeCancelled was
    renamed to be idmsCvWasNotCheckout.
 2) dmsMslExitDMS used to have a argument for return noError. Now, it takes
	no argument, and return the error core by procedure.

* Good-bye procedures:
	All the procedures in iDMS 2.0 are no longer supported in iDMS 2.11
	release.  You have to do proper substitution to replace 2.0 procedures
	with 2.11 procedures. Following is the substitution mapping:
		2.0 procedures		2.11 procedures
		dmsMslReadCellView  ->	dmsMslReadOnlyCellView/CellViewType
		dmsMslWriteCellView ->	dmsMslCheckinCellView
		dmsMslLockCellView  ->  dmsMslCheckoutCellView
		dmsMslUnLockCellView -> dmsMslCancelCheckoutCellView
	New 2.11 procedures are using procedure to return errors (not noError
	any more). So they have	one less argument than 2.0 procedures. Please
	refer to the integration documentation for details.

* Skill interface changes:
 1) Procedure name change.
 	dmsSkillSetTool() ----------> dmsSkillSetCurrentTool()
 
 2) Optional toolname argument on some functions.

	Here's the list of functions that have the optional toolname
	argument:

	dmsSkillCreateCellView
	dmsSkillCreateUnixFile
	dmsSkillReadonlyCellViewType
	dmsSkillReadonlyCellView
	dmsSkillCheckoutCellView
	dmsSkillLoadCellView
	dmsSkillEditCellView
	dmsSkillReadOrEditByPolicy
	dmsSkillSaveCellView
	dmsSkillCheckinCellView
	dmsSkillUpdateCellView
	dmsSkillInstallCellView
	dmsSkillPurgeCellView
	dmsSkillCancelCheckoutCellView
	dmsSkillInfoCellView
	dmsSkillPrintPath
	dmsSkillGetWorkingDir
	dmsSkillGetWorkingLib
 
 3) Return values for dmsSkillInfoCellView()
    2.1 ->  (x_info t_lib t_cell t_view t_ver t_coUser t_path)
    2.11 -> (t_info t_libName t_cell t_view t_ver t_coUser t_path t_location 
 	    t_libPath)
 
 4) Using UNIX environment variables IDMS, IDMS_USERTRIGGERFILE, and 
 	IDMS_DISABLEUSERTRIGGERS.
 
 5) New functions.
 	dmsSkillGetLastCellViewInfo()
 	dmsSkillPrintPath()
 	dmsSkillPurgeCellView()
 	dmsSkillReadonlyCellView()
 	dmsSkillReportMessage()
	
Appendix A: Known Bugs
----------------------
Following is the list of known iDMS bugs:

1) Description of the bug:
	dmsPIExitDMS tries to save closed cdba cellviews to the disk 
	instead of simply exiting. 

   Impact:
	As dmsPIExitDMS erroneously saves the closed cdba cellviews 
	to the disk, it will cause the next cdba write to fail.

   Fix:
	Cadence needs to fix dmsPIExitDMS procedure so that 
	closed cdba cellviews will not be saved to the disk.

   Work-around: 
	Until we receive a fix from Cadence, we recommend the
	following work-around.

	Tools need to call dmsExitDMS to avoid the dummy save.
        In the dmsExitDMS, iDMS skips the daTerminatePI procedure which
        tries to save closed cdba cellviews.

  Affected tools:
	Only those tools which access PDFW CDBA interface.

2) Description of the bug:
  	Link lock on a version is always released after 
	dmsInfoCellView call. 

   Impact:
	No protection against deleting the cellviews that 
	were read by active processes at that time.

   Fix:
	dmsInfoCellView will be modified so that it will not
	leave the side-affect of "releasing the link lock"
	for the calling procedure.

   Work-around:
	There is no work-around in the code.

   Affected tools:
	Any tool that uses dmsInfoCellView call.

3) Description of the bug:
	Hierarchical attributes not inherited correctly.  Hierarchical
	attributes that are listed in the global file are not passed on
	to future revisions.

   Impact:
	Minor.

   Fix:
	Next release.

   Work-around:
	None in this release.

   Affected tools:
	None.

4) Description of the bug:
	dmsCellViewInfo returns nil fullPathName for versions with zero length.

   Impact:
	Can not locate empty file properly.

   Fix:
	Next release.

   Work-around:
	None.

   Affected tools:
	All.
